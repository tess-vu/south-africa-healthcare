# To-Do List

Bolded items are the more "urgent" ones.

- [ ] **Adjust/Clean this markdown, transfer it to quarto markdown, then remove to-do list (anyone when time permits)**
- [x] Pharmacy data cleaning (Tess)
- [ ] **Google Places API geocoding (Joey)**
- [ ] **Create nicer EDA visuals from census (Tess, since I already started it, but others are welcome to do their own and we can compare!)**
- [ ] Wireframing/Designing UX/UI (Alex)
- [ ] Datasheets for Datasets (anyone, task is for later down the line and is essentially robustly reporting on our data which we will need to add the the markdown anyway)
- [ ] **Email Raesetje and Nyalleng our current progress, potential hurdles, and finalized map layers with fields and attributes they can give feedback on (Jillian? Others can pitch in but Jillian could maintain as the single point of contact to make it streamline?)**
